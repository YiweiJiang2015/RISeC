1) Measure butter and shortening onto a plate, put into freezer for about 20 minutes.
2) Measure cake flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, salt and baking powder into the bowl of a food processor.
3) Pulse for a few seconds to mix.
4) Take 1/2 of the cold butter and 1/2 of the cold shortening, put into processor with dry ingredients and pulse off and on for about 1 minute.
5) Scrape down twice while doing this.
6) Take remainder of the cold butter and cold shortening and cut in very briefly with the processor, leaving visible pea-sized chunks.
7) In a measuring cup, mix egg yolk and vinegar together, add ice cubes and water.
8) Let this get chilled, about 3 to 4 minutes.
9) Remove mixed flours and shortening from processor, put into a large mixing bowl.
10) Sprinkle approximately 4 to 5 tablespoons of this egg, water, vinegar mixture, a little at a time, mixing gently with a fork.
11) The key to this is, you do not want a wet dough, and you do not want to overmix.
12) Place this dough into plastic wrap or plastic bag, chill in refrigerator for a few minutes.
13) Remove from refrigerator and roll out.
