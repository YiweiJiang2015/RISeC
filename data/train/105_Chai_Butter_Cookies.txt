1) In a large bowl, cream together the butter, 1 1/3 cups sugar, and chai tea mix until light and fluffy.
2) Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.
3) Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; blend into the creamed mixture until all of the dry has been absorbed.
4) Cover the dough, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
5) Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
6) Roll the cookie dough into walnut sized balls, and roll the balls in sugar.
7) Place the cookies onto greased cookie sheets about 3 inches apart, and flatten slightly using the tines of a fork.
8) Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, just until the edges begin to brown.
9) Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
