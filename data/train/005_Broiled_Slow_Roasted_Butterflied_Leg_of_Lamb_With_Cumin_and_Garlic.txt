1) Mix oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin and oregano; spread paste on both sides of the lamb and let stand for an hour until meat comes to room temperature.
2) Adjust oven rack to upper or upper-middle position (depending on lamb's thickness) and preheat broiler on high for at least 10 minutes.
3) Place lamb, cut side up, on a large wire rack set over a foil-lined roasting pan.
4) Broil, moving pan so entire surface browns evenly, about 8 minutes.
5) Turn lamb over; continue to broil until well browned on the other side, about 8 minutes longer.
6) Turn off broiler, remove lamb from oven and let rest for 10 minutes.
7) Heat oven to 325 degrees.
8) Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the lamb; return it to the oven.
9) Roast for a total of 50 minutes to 1 hour, until thermometer registers a rosy-pink 140 degrees.
10) Check lamb several times after 30 minutes.
11) If lamb gets done sooner, simply turn down oven to 170 degrees until ready to serve.
12) As soon as lamb comes out of the oven, squeeze on lemon juice and sprinkle with fresh herbs.
13) Carve, slicing across the grain when possible.
14) Arrange on a platter, drizzle with accumulated juices, and serve.
